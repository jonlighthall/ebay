<p class="Body_Style">My name is Dr. Jon Lighthall and I run the eBay store World eCycling.&nbsp; 
By profession I am a nuclear physicist, but I occasionally sell things on eBay 
as a hobby.&nbsp; However, hobby or not, every transaction is important to me 
and I will always guarantee your satisfaction.&nbsp; But don't take my word for 
it, look at my feedback; I've received over 1,000 positive feedback reviews from 
individual buyers.&nbsp; And now after over ten years on ebay, I am finally a Top-rated Seller!</p>
<p class="Body_Style">I began selling textbooks on eBay in 2003.&nbsp; Most of the books I sold were surplus from 
around campus.&nbsp; As a result, I was able to sell all of my books&nbsp;at drastically 
reduced prices.&nbsp; Although I no longer have a great supply of textbooks, I 
continue to be committed to offering my buyers the best deals I can afford.&nbsp; 
That's why all of my auctions start out at a penny.</p>
