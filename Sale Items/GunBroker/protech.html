For sale, a used Protech Godson automatic knife, model 721.&nbsp; This is the 
3.25" version of the famous 4" Godfather knife.&nbsp; Original MSRP $220.&nbsp; 
Features a solid black aluminum handle in the Italian-inspired coffin profile 
and a154-CM stainless steel blade with a mate black diamon-like carbon (DLC) 
coating.&nbsp; I used this knife as a utility knife for about two years and it 
shows wear accordingly.&nbsp; The spring mechanism failed at one point and I 
sent it in to Protech for repairs, so it's got a new spring in it. Free shipping via USPS 
First Class Mail.<p align="center">
