I've received a number of questions about the age and quality of the rifle and 
scope.&nbsp; Here are some additional photographs to try to help answer them.&nbsp; 
Based on what I've been able to interpret from the barrel stamps (shown below), 
the rifle was manufactured in June 1968 (PR) and repaired (3) in April 1976 
(CI).&nbsp; This is consistent with I remember hearing from my dad.&nbsp; I'm 
almost positive it hasn't been fired in 30 years.&nbsp; I can only imagine the 
scope is original.&nbsp; As for how the rifle shoots and the quality of the 
scope, my dad was a competition marksman, so I have to believe the rifle shoots 
pretty well.&nbsp; However, I've never fired it.<p align="center">
