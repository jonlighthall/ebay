<p><u>This post includes:</u><br>One ticket for the 6th home game of the 2016 
LSU football season. Buy this ticket to see the LSU Tigers face off against the 
Alabama Crimson Tide on Saturday, November 5th, 2016 at 7:00 pm CT. Section 618, 
Row 14. The seat number has been concealed for privacy. </p>
<p>In addition to the actual ticket you will be purchasing, the pictures show 
the view from Section 618 (both real and virtual) and seat map showing the 
location of Section 618.</p>
<p><u>Notes on this post:</u><br>I was one of the winners of the 2016 LSU 
Faculty Senate Football Ticket Raffle. A friend of mine has an extra ticket, so 
I don't need mine.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I'm not selling this ticket on StubHub. Since I got 
this ticket as part of a raffle, it is a "special" ticket and cannot be sold by 
barcode or other electronic means (note the "FS Lotto" marking on the ticket). I 
have, however, made absolutely sure with the LSU Ticket Office that I am allowed 
sell this ticket.</p>
<p>I have this ticket listed on eBay and will be modulating the price of this 
listing to reflect either the lowest price on StubHub (for tickets available in 
Section 618) or the price of the eBay listing, whichever is greater.</p>
<p><u>Terms and Conditions:</u><br>Offers are welcome—no reasonable offer will be declined!<br>All of my items are guaranteed or your money back.<br>Cash, PayPal, and 
Chase QuickPay accepted.<br>Local pickup only.</p>
<p><u>Location:</u><br>Since electronic delivery of this ticket is not 
available, it is only available via local pickup. The ticket will be available 
for pickup at Nicholson Hall, right next to the stadium.</p>
