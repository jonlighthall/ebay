<p ><span class="auto-style1">Notes on this post</span><font color="blue">:</font><br>
I bought this speaker new from a specialty audio shop in January 2006 for $239 
USD ($276 CAD). I've used it as my center channel since then until December 
2014. I estimate its usage at 7,000 hours. I've had no problems with it and it 
still sounds great. I fell victim to an enticing Boxing Day sale wherein I 
needlessly bought a new center channel, so I don't need this one any more. I 
always operated this speaker in bi-wired mode; however, the original hardware to 
bridge the high-frequency and low-frequency terminals is included. </p>
