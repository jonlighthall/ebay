<p class="Title_Style">Electro-Harmonix EL34 Quartet</p>
<p class="Price_Style">$64.99 MSRP</p>
<p class="Body_Style">For sale, a used matched quartet of EL34 vacuum tubes from 
Electro-Harmonix. All of the tubes are labeled EL34, Made in Russia, and feature the Electro-Harmonix logo that identifies the tubes as EL34EH. The letters EH at the end of the 
tube name simply indicate that it is an Electro-Harmonix tube.</p>
<p class="Body_Style">Three of the tubes have the date code 0712, indicating that the tubes were made 
in February 2012. The fourth tube has the date code 0803, indicated that the tube was made in February 2003.</p>
<p class="Body_Style">The tubes are all part of a quad-matched set. All of the tubes were tested to have plate current (Ip) 22&thinsp;mA and transconductance (Gm) 4.6&thinsp;S. 
The vacuum was also specified for the set as a "hard" vacuum. A hard vacuum should provide a longer lifetime and a higher distortion threshold.</p>

<p class="Section_Style">Notes on This Auction:</p>
<table class="Hightlight">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="Body_Style">I bought these tubes for the power stage of my hi-fi 
stereo amplifier in September 2012. They have been used approximately 1,500 hours since. The 
manufacturer of the amplifier advises that the power tubes should last 3,000 
hours. Therefore, these tubes are thoroughly broken in and about half-way 
through their useful life.</p>
<p class="Body_Style">I had these tubes installed when I accidentally shorted out the bias supply on one of the power tubes sockets in May 2014. However, the tubes still function, which is why I'm selling them. The tubes are labeled with marker on the base.</p>

<table class="Hightlight">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="Title_Style">Why is the starting price so low?</p>
<p class="Body_Style">Bid with confidence! I always start my auctions at a low price, without a reserve price. That way my items are sure to sell and I always get, by definition, the full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value" target="_blank">market value</a> for my items. If an item has <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.ebay.com/jonlighthall/m.html?rt=nc&LH_FS=1&_fln=1&_ipg=&_trksid=p3911.c0.m283">free shipping</a> <i>and</i> a low starting price, it is an <b>inventory clearance item</b>. These items have gone unsold and must be cleared from inventory, even if I have to help pay for shipping. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="Title_Style">Can I buy it now?</p>
<p class="Body_Style">Only items which offer local pickup as a shipping option will include a Buy It Now price. Otherwise, <strong>I will never end an auction early or add a Buy It Now option.</strong> Please do not ask me to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="Title_Style">How can I pay for my item?</p>
<p class="Body_Style">I will accept nearly any form of payment. However, I expect electronic payment via PayPal within a reasonable time after the end of the listing. Other arrangements can be made, but without prior notification an item that is unpaid after <strong>4 days</strong> of the end of the listing will be subject to an Unpaid Item case.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="Title_Style">How soon will the item be shipped?</p>
<p class="Body_Style">All of my listings have <strong>same-day handling</strong> times. I usually ship items within a few hours after I receive payment.</p>
