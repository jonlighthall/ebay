I have one too many couches in my apartment!<br>If you can take it off my hands, 
I'll pay you $20!</p>
<p ><u><font color="blue">This post includes:</font></u><br>
This is a metal frame couch made by La-Z-Boy as a part of the American Home 
Collection.<br>It 
appears to be an English roll arm style couch.<br>It has three removable 
seat cushions. The back cushions are not removable (they are sewn in place).<br>The color is mainly red 
and green plaid with blue and gold accents.<br></p>
<p ><u><font color="blue">Notes on this post:</font></u><br>
This couch has seen heavy daily use for over two decades and shows wear 
accordingly.<br>There is some significant damage to the upholstery on the 
corners of the couch from cats scratching at it.<br>The upholstery is threadbare 
in places, particularly on the edges of the cushions.<br>Although there is pet 
damage, the house has been pet-free (and smoke-free) for three years.<br>Despite 
its heavy use, the couch is clean, stain-free, and odor-free.</p>
