This is a very lightly-used car in great condition. It belongs to my wife and 
she uses almost exclusively for her six-mile commute to work. It's always been 
kept clean and no one has ever smoked in it. The car has been well maintained at 
the dealership and the lease includes all additional maintenance at Naperville 
Chevrolet. Features Factory Warranty, XM satellite radio, OnStar, and Bluetooth.
